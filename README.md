# CyberPlusPlus
This is the repo for parts of the old codes from Cyber++, an autonomous racing model car we built in 2011.
Cyber_NT3 contains the embedded C codes that run in the car, written mainly by my friend iceboy using CodeWarrior.
SmartCar contains the Python and C code I wrote to receive and plot data in real time via bluetooth I2C.
